## Technology
The frontend of EasyCal is built using React with React Router.  I'm most familiar with Java as a backend language, so all REST endpoints use Play! 1.4.4, a Java-powered MVC web framework.  For details on the data models and implementations, visit the backend repo [here](https://github.com/mileshenrichs/easycal-backend).  All food and nutrition data comes from the [USDA Food Composition Databases](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/index).

## Libraries Used
* __[immutability-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immutability-helper):__ Immutability helper's `update()` function made nested state objects easy to update without mutation
* __[react-day-picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-day-picker):__ React Day Picker provided a ready-to-use date selection utility to navigate daily logs and set specific date ranges for which to view statistics
* __[moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment):__ Moment's helpful date utilities came in handy for setting and displaying dates on the Stats page
* __[react-highcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highcharts):__ React Highcharts allowed for rendering and updating of a [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)-powered food & exercise graph on the Stats page
* __[qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs):__ qs allowed for parsing of query strings throughout the application
* __[react-favicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-favicon):__ For whatever reason, I was having trouble getting my `favicon.ico` file in `/public` to show up, but react-favicon did the trick

## Features

* Create custom foods
* View food log for any day of your choosing using the date navigator on the home page
* Modify serving sizes of foods in your log
* Remove foods from your log
* Enter calories burned from exercise each day
* Set daily calorie and nutrient goals, see progress towards those goals in the daily log
* View nutrition breakdowns for any date range: total and average macro __and__ micro nutrients
* See a graph of food consumption and exercise over time

## Component Hierarchy

### DayView: home screen, daily food log
__DayView__ is the home page of EasyCal.  It's where you view the foods you've eaten throughout the day, and input your exercise.
Contains components:
* __DaySelect__: choose which day to view food log of, implements _react-day-picker_
* __Calotron__: display net calories for given day (`caloriesEaten - caloriesBurned`)
* __MealGroup:__ list/table of foods eaten for a given meal (contains __MealItem__, __AddFoodItem__, and __MealTotalsRow__)
* __ActivityInput__: input calories burned from exercise
* __NetCalories__: show equation that calculates day's net calories
* __MacroTotals__: show the day's macronutrient intake and how close each is to user's goal

### AddFoodView: search foods, select serving size, add to log
__AddFoodView__ allows users to search for foods, view recent foods, and create new foods to add to their daily log.
Contains components: 
* __SearchFood__: search bar allowing access to USDA foods database
* __FoodsPanel__: tabs to navigate between __SearchResults__, __RecentFoods__, and __MyFoods__ components (each of which contains __AddableFoodItem__ components)
* __CreateFoodView__: not technically contained by __AddFoodView__, but closely related; provides form through which users and create their own foods with serving size and nutrition information

### StatisticsView: cumulative statistics, calories graph
__StatisticsView__ is a useful way of evaluating your dietary habits over time.  Here, you can view a more detailed breakdown of the foods you eat, including micronutrients like fiber, sugar, and sodium.
Contains components:
* __StatsTable__: day-by-day breakdown of total calories and nutrients (contains __StatsDayItem__)
* __WeekAverages__: table that shows average calories and nutrients during selected date period
* __ExerciseGraph__: Highcharts line graph illustrating calories burned and calories consumed over time

### MyAccountView: set goals, log out
__MyAccountView__ allows users to set & save their calorie and nutrient goals.
Contains components:
* __MyGoals__: form to set/modify user goals

### Utility/Miscellaneous Components
* __LogInView__: log in or register an account; users are redirected here if their login token (a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/)) is absent or invalid
* __Header__: site header, contains logo and navigation
* __Footer__: standard footer, contains logo and nav links
* __AuthLoader__: full-screen loading spinner to hide __DayView__ when app is initally loaded and waiting for authentication results from [backend](https://github.com/mileshenrichs/easycal-backend)

## Deployment
Deployment was a little tricky on both the front- and back-end.  Since `npm run build` creates a static directory, I was able to upload these files to the Namecheap hosting account I purchased with my domain via cPanel's interface.  I had to switch from using `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` to prevent my frontend server from looking for directories for each of my routes (i.e. `/stats`, `/add`, etc).
